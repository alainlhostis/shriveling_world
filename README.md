# Shriveling world

The __shriveling world__ project aims at producing images of _geographical time-space_, using the third dimension. The word _shriveling_ was introduced by Waldo Tobler in [his analysis](https://people.geog.ucsb.edu/~tobler/presentations/The-shriveling-world.pdf) of Mathis-L'Hostis time-space relief images, to describe the complex contraction process suggested by the model. The project consists in:

- A [scientific blog](https://timespace.hypotheses.org/) containing principles, reflections, references and images related to the project
- An [__application__ with documentation](https://theworldisnotflat.github.io/shriveling_world/marks/index).
- A [users forum](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world/discussions)

This is the first representation of _geographical time-space_ with cones and curves, produced by the application __Shriveling world__ with post-treatments in [Blender](https://www.blender.org), applied to China and Taiwan.
