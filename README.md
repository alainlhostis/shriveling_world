Shriveling the world
=====================

The  "shriveling_world" project aims at producing images of the global geographical time-space, using the third dimension, as in time-space relief maps.
The word "shriveling" was introduced by Waldo Tobler in his comments of Mathis-L'Hostis time-space relief image, in order to describe the complex contraction process suggested by the model.
A [scientific blog](https://timespace.hypotheses.org/) contains principles, reflections, references and images related to the project.

# How to use

## For users: first steps
**Step #1**:The app runs in a browser from this adress:

[Shriveling world](https://theworldisnotflat.github.io/shriveling_world_documentation/app/)

**Step #2**: Once the app runs in the browser data is read by two ways:

a. Cick on predefined dataset list on the left side of the broser window
b. Introduce data in the app by grag'n'drop (see below)

Attention: in any case data processing may take time, depending on the number of cities. So once 

**Step #3**: enjoy! navigate around the threedimensional structure with mouse controls, define projection through interface, define desired control parameters through the interface on the right. Reload the page in the browser before changing dataset.

## Introducing data in the application by drag'n'drop


Drag'n'drop the following geojson and csv files found in the folder datasets in the web app:
- cities.csv
- population.csv
- transport_mode_code.csv
- transport_mode_speed.csv
- transport_network.csv
- 110m_land_shrivel.geojson

## Instructions for use
Instructions for the application are provided in a lateral user interface.

Export to gltf (.obj) file format is available (red button in the bottom). In order to import in Blender the file produced from the app, [a Blender plugin must be installed](https://github.com/ksons/gltf-blender-importer)

Instructions to the application can also be entered in the console (F12) of the browser

```shriveling.configuration.XXX=value```

with XXX and value in the following range:

- intrudedHeightRatio : sets the heigth of cones, in the range [0,1], a ratio of the earth radius

For these other command lines an UI already exists
- coneStep :  modifies the visual aspect of cones (default value is 15 degrees, a facet = 15Â°)
- projectionInit : initial projection with values in in the following range :
  - 'none' for a three dimensional unprojected representation
  - 'equirectangular' or 1 for an equilateral flat representation
  - 'Mercator' or 2 for a 2-dimensional Mercator
- projectionEnd : the final projection with value as projectionBegin
- projectionPercent: transition value between projectionBegin and projectionEnd. Value included in the range 0 to 100 included.
- year: base year of the representation (value in the networks files)
- pointsPerCurve=X where X is an integer between 1 and 199 included. This value influences the way curves are drawn. The value **zero** draws all straight lines, while the value **1** draws broken lines

## Testing lengths and angles

As the final output of the tool is, in the general case, an image, testing the distances and angles is a way to make sure the model is correct:
- length of straight edges and links can be [measured with a ruler on the screen](https://timespace.hypotheses.org/115) or on a printed image
- length of curves may be measured by means of a little string adjusted along the image and then measured with the ruler
- measuring angles with [an on-line protractor tool](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/angle_measurement/)



## For developpers

### Requisites
You need updated version of node.js, npm and nvm:
- [node latest version](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#deb)

- ```nvm install node ```

Does not work with old version of nodejs (with version 4 does not work, with version 8 to 11 does)


### Configuration of your IDE

In your IDE, need to install xo extension :

- [vscode-linter-xo](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-linter-xo) for vscode
- [linter-xo](https://github.com/xojs/atom-linter-xo) for atom


### Compiling sources and launching the server
First you need to download sources from this github page. Copy the folder on your machine.
Go inside the application folder and open a terminal, execute the following lines, one by one:

```npm i```  (update nodejs)

```gulp```   (compile sources) or ``` gulp --testing --debug``` for development (faster, does not minify)

```gulp server``` (launch server)

```gulp doc``` (compile documentation)

Then open in a browser this adress http://localhost:8080.


# Road map
- A [roadmap is maintained up to date here](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world/wiki)
- Development is [organised for the coming release](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world/projects)
