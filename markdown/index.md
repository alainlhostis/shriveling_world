# Shriveling world project

Welcome to the __Shriveling world__ project website

* The main objective of the project is to develop a functional [Shriveling world application](app)
* The project has a [scientific blog dedicated to the representation of geographical time-space](https://timespace.hypotheses.org/)
* The project has a [discussion forum](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world/discussions) dedicated to users
* The project has a [github](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world) open for collaboration
* Bug reports and features requests should be dealt with in the dedicated [issue section of GitHub](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world/issues)

# Shriveling world

The __shriveling world__ project aims at producing images of _geographical time-space_, using the third dimension. The word _shriveling_ was introduced by Waldo Tobler in [his analysis](https://people.geog.ucsb.edu/~tobler/presentations/The-shriveling-world.pdf) of Mathis-L'Hostis time-space relief images, to describe the complex contraction process suggested by the model. The project consists in:

- A [scientific blog](https://timespace.hypotheses.org/) containing principles, reflections, references and images related to the project
- An [__application__ with documentation](https://theworldisnotflat.github.io/shriveling_world/marks/index).
- A [users forum](https://github.com/theworldisnotflat/shriveling_world/discussions)

This is the first representation of _geographical time-space_ with cones and curves, produced by the application __Shriveling world__ with post-treatments in [Blender](https://www.blender.org), applied to China and Taiwan.
