# The three dimensional geometry of the model

## Cones

Cones geometry is determined by three main parameters:

* The slope of cones is fixed, for a given year, by the ratio between the maximum available speed and the speed in the banal geographical space, the road speed.

* The radius of cones  is a parameter fixed at global level or local level.
  * At global level radius is by default fixed at 1500 km in order to [join the cones of cities located on each side of the most empty earth surface on earth namely the Sahara desert](https://timespace.hypotheses.org/83).
  * At the local level a shorter cone may be necessary for the case of cities in islands located close to an empty (from the urban point of view) continent as in the situation of Canary Islands close to Morocco.

* The height of cones is determined by the previous computed or chosen parameters, slope and radius.

Cones geometry is also modifiable through the user interface:

* The variable ```coneStep``` determines the width, in degrees, of the facets that constitute the cone; a minimum value of 1 degree will produce a cone based on 360 small three dimensional triangles

* Color

* Transparency

The model allows to generate several sub models for the slope of cones:
