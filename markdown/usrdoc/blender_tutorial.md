# Shriveling World in Blender

## Intro

[Shriveling World](https://theworldisnotflat.github.io/shriveling_world_documentation) is a web app intended to explore shriveled maps (multi-modal maps) of different datasets directly in your browser.

The application allows you to get an accurate representation of the model through interactive parameters.
But it is now easier to use advanced 3D software to fine tune the appearance of the outputs.

## Why Blender?

We chose [Blender](https://www.blender.org) because it‚Äôs a free and cross platform open source 3D creation suite that allows advanced shading, lighting and rendering options to tweak the visual output of the Shriveling World app.

Of course any 3D tool could be used as long as it supports .obj file.

**[Download Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)**
(2.90.1 as of 16 october 2020)

The tutorial below is designed as a quick start to import data from the Shriveling App and effectively organize your scene in Blender[^version].


## Step by step [(ooh üîä)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCrargw1rrM)

After exporting from app you should have a zip file containing 4 files:

- _country.obj_, the country limits contained in the 'geojson' input file
- _sceneCones.obj_, base geometry for terrestrial transport
- _sceneCurvesLongHaul.obj_, long distance flights
- _sceneCurvesShortHaul.obj_, short distance flights

Let‚Äôs get started.

### Import OBJ

1. Open Blender
2. New File > General
3. With your mouse in the [_3D Viewport_](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/introduction.html) editor‚Äôs area **remove everything in the scene**
    - Press **A** (Select All)
	- Press **X** (then confirm by pressing **D**, **Enter** or click **‚ÄúDelete‚Äù** in the contextual pop-up) or press **BackSpace** (for instant delete)
4. File > Import > Wavefront (.obj)

 In the _Blender File View_, find and select the .obj file on your system, then click **Import OBJ** or press **Enter**. The OBJ import allows only one file at a time.

Objects are named before exportation from 'Shriveling world' and will show in the right [_Outliner_](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/outliner.html) panel:

 * _cone Tokyo_
 * _cone Hiroshima_
 * ...
 * _curve HST 001_
 * _curve HST 002_
 * _curve Aircraft 001_
 * ...

 For the sake of organization we can import each .obj file in a [collection](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/collections/introduction.html). We could do this by creating a collection for each additional import and renaming each collection to our needs in the [_Outliner_](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/outliner.html).

 Select the desired collection in the _Outliner_ before importing the corresponding file as mentioned before.

Now we have imported our meshes, we can work in Blender as we like.
Tweak the geometry, set materials, lights, cameras and make renders.

However a few tips could be helpful.

### The beauties of Blender interface

The __Viewport__ is the central part of the screen, where all the objects and the scene are.

* It is often useful to toggle on and off __Show overlays__. For instance when a group of objects is selected, modified and you want to see the result in render; then toggle off View overlay hides the yellow selection lighting; here is the way:
   * in the top right part of the _Viewport_ toggle the __Show overlays__ checkbox. Grids, red and green lines, the orange halo of selection, etc.  will disappear.

#### Navigating in the scene
* Rotation of the view = maintain __middle click__ and move mouse
* Translation of the view = maintain __middle click + Shift__ and move mouse
### Working with 3D objects

<small>J‚Äôinclus (temporairement) une [initiation √† la mod√©lisation sous Blender](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/vincent.nivoliers/mif27/tuto_blender28.php) en fran√ßais (comme l‚Äô√©quipe actuelle est essentiellement francophone). Son auteur [Vincent Nivoliers](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/vincent.nivoliers/) travaille comme assistant professeur √† [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr) (je suis tomb√© dessus totalement par hasard) mais revenons √† nos moutons‚Ä¶</small>

#### Moving objects

Select objects and then:
* type __G__ and then mouse movements move selected objects


#### Cones

The shriveled topology exported as .obj file is composed of individual ‚Äúcones‚Äù each named by the city on top.

Our intention here is to turn the collection of cones into a single multi-cones surface and remove the unneeded artifacts below the surface.

It is quite hard to keep accurate geometry when trying to model the mesh surface depending of the source file and its complexity. But one method looks promising.

1. In the _Outliner_, duplicate the cones collection (so we can keep track of original cones for comparison later)
2. <a id="hide"></a>Hide everything but the new working collection by **ctrl-clicking** on the **eye icon** next to it (isolate to optimise the viewport)
3. [Select all objects](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/outliner.html#selecting-multiple-data-blocks) (cones) of that new collection. One object must be active (yellow) in the objects selection (orange). It will become the main object
4. In the _3D Viewport_, join every selected cone meshes in one object (**Ctrl-J** or **Cmd-J** on macOS). You can rename the joined object as you like
5. Switch to *Sculpt Mode* and use the **[Remesh](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/retopology.html#remeshing)** tool in the top-right corner of the _3D Viewport_ area (the Blender doc about remeshing is unfortunately not up to date). _Voxel Size_ should be 0.1 or less (**Warning**: it could be computational intensive but a lower value gives more details)
6. Add *Decimate modifier* to lighten the mesh
7. WIP Boolean the geographic borders. Need source
8. WIP Remove vertices of the bases to keep only the surface (non manifold object)

#### Curves

Depending on the value set for _Curves > number of points_[^naming] before exporting, results may vary (higher number should give more accurate curves).

In Blender, the straightforward way to work with things that looks like curve is using, guess what, _[Curves](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/curves/introduction.html)_! We are going to convert our faceless meshes to real curves‚Ä¶ but before that:

<small>Temporary comment:</small>
For now the exported mesh geometry for ‚Äúcurves‚Äù include center of the earth reference vertex for each ‚Äúcurve‚Äù. If we find a solution it would be nice to export the .obj file without those center vertices.

Let‚Äôs remove those vertex in Blender.

#### Remove center vertex

1. Toggle X-Ray (with your mouse in the top right corner of the  _3D Viewport_ press **Alt+Z** or click on the <img src="./img/icon_x-ray@2x.png" alt="X-Ray Icon Inactive" title="X-Ray Icon Inactive" width="20" height="20" /> icon) to enable the selection of overlapping elements.
2. Select all the ‚Äúcurve‚Äù objects. Either :
	-  by pressing **A** (Select All) while your mouse is in the _3D Viewport_ (and with only the wanted objects visible)
	- with one of the _[selection tools](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/selecting.html#selection-tools)_
	- with the _[Outliner](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/view_layers/introduction.html#outliner)_.
	**Warning:** depending on context (for example if the last active object was hidden from view), one pitfall could be a selection with no active object at all (with only orange outline). Be sure to have an [active object](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/selecting.html#selections-and-the-active-object) (with yellow outline) in the selection before continuing.
3. Switch to _Edit Mode_ (Press **Tab**).
4. Select all the vertices located at the World Origin with the _Select Box_ tool.
5. Delete them (Press **X** then **Enter**)

#### Convert objects to curves

In order to control size of curves we need to convert the imported meshes int curves objects in Blender:

1. Switch to _Object Mode_ (Press **Tab**)
2. Select all the meshes you want to convert
   * Beware: you should first manually select one curve in the _Viewport_ before selecting all the others; the first selected should appear in yellow and the others on orange; if you have not done this subsequent operations may not work
3. Convert still selected objects to curve (_Object > Convert to > Curve from Mesh/Text_ or press **F3** (Menu Search), type ‚Äúconvert‚Äù and choose corresponding function)

#### Set curves width
1. Select the curves you want to modify
2. Open _Object Data Properties_ [tab](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/tabs_panels.html) located at the bottom right
3. Check that _Fill Mode_ is set to ‚ÄúFull‚Äù
4. Open _[Geometry](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/curves/properties/geometry.html#)_ panel and in the _Bevel_ [subpanel](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/tabs_panels.html#panels) set _Depth_. A proposed relevant value can be __0.02 m__

This operation may be done on only one object and then [applied to others](#apply-properties-to-all-selected-objects).

#### Apply properties to all selected objects

To apply properties to all selected objects (because changes you make in _Object Data Properties_ only affect active object) **right click** on the modified _[Fields](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/buttons/fields.html)_ to open a contextual menu and choose _Copy to Selected_. In case you have already [joined the curves](#cones), this step is not needed.

### Rendering

#### Removing objects from rendering
You may remove from rendering several objects, e.g. countries, and keep then for a later use:
1. in the _Scene collection_ right click on an objet or a collection of objects
2. in the popup menu choose __Visibility__
3. in the sub-menu choose __Disable in render__

A quicker and more convenient way consists in adding columns in objects box on top right. Click the tiny funnel on top right, and select the __Disable in Renders__ selection toggle.

#### Rendering parameters

Rendering parameters can be accessed in the properties box, down right. Click on the __Render properties__ tab.

* In Blender two main __Rendering engines__ are available:
  * [EEVEE](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/eevee/introduction.html), by default, is fast with decent result
  * [Cycles](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/introduction.html) allows to reach photorealism but can be slow
* It is preferable to synchronize the values of sampling between _Render_ and _Viewport_, at the level __64__. Shadows should be better rendered while working on the scene

#### Transparent background

So far a __transparent background__ gives good results in rendering. In order to get this:
* Set _background_ to _black_
  * In the down right properties box select __World properties__
  * Change __Color__ to black (so that the background does not interfere with the objects in scene)
* You'll also need to remove the background from the render:
   * In the down right properties box select __Render properties__
   * Down below in section __Film__ click __Transparent__ (Film refers to the historical celluloid ribbon on which cartoons where drawn)

### Camera

WIP Explain different [Camera](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cameras.html#properties) settings (*Orthographic* vs *Perspective* for example) specific to Shriveling.

If in the [first step](#import-obj) you removed the default camera, you will need to create a new one.

#### Create camera

1. In Modelling mode
2. In top left part of the _3D viewport_ click on __Add__ and then on __Camera__

#### Update camera view

__Ctrl+Alt+0__ in case you have a numpad

It is possible to lock the camera to the current view:
1. type __N__, a tiny menu on the right of the viewport shows up
2. switch to the __View__ section of this menu
3. then in __View lock__ select __Camera to view__

#### Objects lost from sight in Camera view

* The camera view may be lost ot a "user perspective" that is precised in the upper left part of the _Viewport_. Toggling between the two perspectives is done by a click on the __Camera icon__ on the right of the _Viewport_ or by choosing from top left part of the Viewport __View -> Camera -> Active camera__.

* Objects may be lost from view when zooming or de-zooming with the camera view selected. This unintended behavior can be adapted by changing the camera properties:
  1. Select the camera
  2. Click on the __Camera tab__ in the Object properties box, down right
  3. In section __Lens__ set __Clip end__ at a different value, for instance from 100 m to __1000 m__


### Materials / Shading / Lighting

WIP Explain briefly which _[Materials](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/materials/introduction.html)_ and/or _[Shaders](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/introduction.html)_ to use to get nice results.

WIP PBR vs NPR, shadeless, transparency, colors‚Ä¶

#### Curves material
Good results have been obtained by using an Emission material for curves that allows to set a very bright color.
* First select a curve
* In the right down __Properties box__, create (1) or attribute an existing material (2) to the object:
  1. Create a __New__ material with:
     * __Surface__ set to __Emission__
	 * __Color__ set to Red, Blue or else
	 * __Strength__ default value of __1__ may be adjusted to __2__ or more. This parameter should be considered together with the width of the curve, [set by the Bevel value](#convert-objects-to-curves)
  2. A tiny button on the left gives access to _existing_ materials. Beware: if you change the material properties here this will affect the other objects using this material

#### The shaders with nodes

Shaders can be awfully complicated. This is why the Shaders interface is here to help.

* It is strongly recommended to use the __Node wrangler__ addon
* It is relevant to [toggle/un-toggle the Overlays](#the-beauties-of-blender-interface)
* After a click on the material, __Ctrl+T__  will generate a texture. We can remove the __Image texture__ and remake the connection (thanks to Node wrangler)
* After a click on Mapp√Æng, __Ctrl+Shift+click__ will generate a viewer; connecting the MApping to different variables of the Texture coordinates box will generate colors in the objects that can be used to create gradients; in order to highlight some parts of the geometry we want to emphasize
* In the end reconnect directly the material to the __Surface__ of __Material output__

### Lights

Good results are obtained by using one or several _suns_ and additional punctual sources (_point_) to highlight some elements of the scene.

#### Creating a light
* In __Layout view__, click on internal menu __Add__ and then __Light__
* Existing lights can be turned into _sun_ or _point_ source in the down right box:
  * click on the __Light__ tab
  * change __Point__ into __Sun__ or vice-versa
* __Strength__ may need to be adjusted to higher values than default 1. Value __2__ gives good results
* In case where two _Suns_ are introduced, their __Angles__ must be adjusted to create the desired effect


[^version]: Note: Blender evolves quickly. Since version 2.79b the whole interface has changed and a lot of new features are implemented. The base concepts remain the same so you could get interesting results with any version suited to your computer. However, this tutorial is clearly geared towards recent versions (since 2.80).

[^naming]: In the web-app the naming could be subject to change. ‚ÄúThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.‚Äù -- Phil Karlton.
