## Creating a dataset from scratch

### Example of a French _d√©partement_

#### Download GIS file
#### Generate centroids of communes
#### Create _latitude_ and _longitude_ fields for the centroids
In (QGIS)[https://qgis.org]:
* Create two numerical fields named _latitude_ and _longitude_
* The fields should have at least 3 + 3 precision depth
* Populate each field via the Field calculator with the following formulas:
   * latitude: 'x(centroid($geometry))'
   * longitude: 'y(centroid($geometry))'


* Create a table for the network, based on commune centroids
* rename network table column _trip_id_ into _polyline_id_
* Execute _Explode lines_
* In the new table _exploded_ create a new column called _edge_id_
  * Open _Attribute table_
  * _Toggle editing mode_
  * _Open field calculator_
  * _Create new field_ named _edge_id_
  * Populate it with the _Variable_ called _row_number_
* From the _Processing toolbox_, run the algorithm _Extract specific vertices_
  * with option _Vertex indices_ to value _0_ to generate a new layer of starting points, to be renamed _start_
  * with option _Vertex indices_ to value _1_ to generate a new layer of ending points, to be renamed _end_
* For the _start_ layer:
  * Run an _Intersection_ with _start_ and the _communes_ layer where the id of the points resides
  * Remove unnecessary fields
  * Rename the city id field into _cityCodeOri_ and its name as _cityNameOri_
* For the _end_ layer:
  * Run an _Intersection_ with _end_ and the _communes_ layer where the id of the points resides
  * Remove unnecessary fields
  * Rename the city id field into _cityCodeDes_ and its name as _cityNameDes_

#### Rename key fields
As explained in the dataset files reference, you must rename the relevant following mandatory fields:
* cityCode
* cityName
#### Export centroids to csv
